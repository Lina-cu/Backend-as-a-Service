# E6156 - Topics in SW Engineering: Cloud Computing

The focus of  this fall's 2020 section of Topics in Software Engineering: Cloud Computing continues
to be cloud delivered applications and distributed systems. The unifying theme will
be "[Backend-as-a-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service)" (BaaS),
which is also known as "Mobile Backend-as-a-Service." 

A simple [definition](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/backend-as-a-service-baas/) is:
"Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model in which
developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application
so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend.
BaaS vendors provide pre-written software for activities that take place on servers,
such as user authentication, database management, remote updating, and push notifications
for mobile apps), as well as cloud storage and hosting." 

We will do some simple user interface work, but this is a small smart of the course.
In this course, we do UI only for demonstration and testing purposes. There are other classes in CS at Columbia
that focus on user interface/user experience.
[COMS W4170 - User Interface Design](http://coms4170.cs.columbia.edu/2020-spring/) is an example.
UI/UX is a major discipline by itself.

Several of the major cloud providers offer technology for backend as a service, e.g.
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/mobile/)

The course will use technology from the providers to understand and implement concepts. AWS will be the primary
platform, but the course will cover the other clouds.

Students will work in small teams to develop a simple solution. The teams can choose their specific
project and application as long as it covers the core topics. Students also have flexibility on
specific technology they learn and use in their projects. The instructor will
help the students run their projects using very simple agile development and
continuous integration. Final grade is based on the completeness and quality of the project.


## Topics


An initial/tentative list of topics will include:
1. Integration with productivity applications (G Suite, AWS WorkDocs).
2. Data synchronization and events (Firebase, AWS AppSync).
3. Security (starting with OAuth2).
4. Container-based applications and infrastructure, e.g. Kubernets on cloud IaaS.
5. Cloud databases, tentatively document, wide column and cloud databases.
6. Publish/Subscribe, event driven architecture using cloud services.
7. Service orchestration, workflow, service meshing.
8. Integration with social media.
9. Database/information integration, pipelines, etc.
10. Building multi-tenancy and SaaS applications.
11. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, Agile Development.

## Course Format


The course format will be:
1. Weekly lecture covering the core topics.
2. Suggested reading and documents on details.
3. Weekly team meetings with the professor.

    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The “API Economy” is much more than just a buzz phrase. It’s become a key enabler of digital transformation and agile businesses. In a recent report, McKinsey explains, “As the connective tissue linking ecosystems of technologies and organizations, APIs allow businesses to monetize data, forge profitable partnerships, and open new pathways for innovation and growth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Businesses of all shapes and sizes are reaping benefit from APIs. According to a Harvard Business Review article, Salesforce has generated half of its revenue to through APIs, while Expedia.com has generated a whopping impressive 90% in recent years. APIs have become so essential to businesses that 85% consider web APIs and API-based integration fundamental to their business strategy and continued success. Before implementing an API, it's important to carefully consider what's entailed in a successful API strategy.\n",

    "Broadly speaking, any organization that is launching an API program will be aiming to achieve one or more of the following business goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increasing Revenue Often an API can be a direct source of revenue. This may involve charging developers for access to the API, facilitating the in-house creation of pay-to-play applications or enabling ecommerce. A key consideration here is that the API must offer something worth paying for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extending Customer Reach & Value APIs provide the ideal solution for enterprises that wish to reach new customers or increase the value of current customers by offering existing services via new platforms and devices. In these instances, it is vital to consider technical requirements for these new delivery channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Supporting Sales & Marketing Activities APIs can also help a company to market its products and services, without necessarily becoming involved in how these offerings are delivered. Such an API should enable the creation of the kind of engaging, immersive functionality associated with online marketing best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stimulating Business & Technical Innovation APIs can help an organization develop new systems, offerings and strategies from the inside because they reduce technical barriers to innovation. Specifically, APIs empower organizations to generate and implement ideas without requiring them to change their backend systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Easing Integration of Backend Data & Applications APIs also play a key integration role in a variety of internal IT projects that impact core business goals. In these projects, it is vital to consider the business event or need driving the integration. For example, the integration may result from a merger or from a new regulatory requirement.\n",

    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia]()\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "API management is the process of creating and publishing web application programming interfaces (APIs), enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, nurturing the subscriber community, collecting and analyzing usage statistics, and reporting on performance. API Management components provide mechanisms and tools to support developer and subscriber community\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While solutions vary, components that provide the following functionality are typically found in API management products:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Gateway:__ a server that acts as an API front-end, receives API requests, enforces throttling and security policies, passes requests to the back-end service and then passes the response back to the requester. A gateway often includes a transformation engine to orchestrate and modify the requests and responses on the fly. A gateway can also provide functionality such as collecting analytics data and providing caching. The gateway can provide functionality to support authentication, authorization, security, audit and regulatory compliance.\n",
    "It can be implemented by a Reverse proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Publishing tools:__ a collection of tools that API providers use to define APIs, for instance using the OpenAPI or RAML specifications, generate API documentation, govern API usage through access and usage policies for APIs, test and debug the execution of API, including security testing and automated generation of tests and test suites, deploy APIs into production, staging, and quality assurance environments, and coordinate the overall API lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Developer portal/API store:__ community site, typically branded by an API provider, that can encapsulate for API users in a single convenient source information and functionality including documentation, tutorials, sample code, software development kits, an interactive API console and sandbox to trial APIs, the ability to subscribe to the APIs and manage subscription keys such as OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret, and obtain support from the API provider and user and community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Reporting and analytics:__ functionality to monitor API usage and load (overall hits, completed transactions, number of data objects returned, amount of compute time and other internal resources consumed, volume of data transferred). This can include real-time monitoring of the API with alerts being raised directly or via a higher-level network management system, for instance, if the load on an API has become too great, as well as functionality to analyze historical data, such as transaction logs, to detect usage trends. Functionality can also be provided to create synthetic transactions that can be used to test the performance and behavior of API endpoints. The information gathered by the reporting and analytics functionality can be used by the API provider to optimize the API offering within an organization's overall continuous improvement process and for defining software Service-Level Agreements for APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Monetization:__ functionality to support charging for access to commercial APIs. This functionality can include support for setting up pricing rules, based on usage, load and functionality, issuing invoices and collecting payments including multiple types of credit card payments."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web Services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by __using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.__ Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.\" \\(Emphasis added\\).(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-RESTful applications surface service/domain specific operations, e.g.\n",
    "    - ```open_account(...)```\n",
    "    - ```transfer(...)```\n",
    "    - ```check_balance(...)```\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- The uniform, predefined REST operations are the HTTP Methods:\n",
    "    - GET\n",
    "    - PUT (or PATCH)\n",
    "    - POST\n",
    "    - DELETE\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- These represent Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete operations on __resources__ identified by __URLs.__\n",
    "    - POST is Create\n",
    "    - GET is Retrieve\n",
    "    - PUT (or PATCH) is Update\n",
    "    - DELETE is Delete.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- __Note:__ People often confuse:\n",
    "    - Remote procedure call/service invocation using HTTP\n",
    "    - REST\n",
    "    - They are not the same thing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The six core characteristics of the REST style are:\n",
    "    1. Client–server architecture\n",
    "    1. Statelessness\n",
    "    3. Cacheability\n",
